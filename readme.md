Face: This program draws the face of a viper to the screen, uses basic circle, triangle, and shape functions.

Animation: This program animates four separate for loops that move using sin and y position updates.

Trade Vis: This program shows the trade routes and magnitude of various US imports.

Song Map: This program displays a natural loudness map, sourced from earthsky.org. Dark blues correspond with loud areas, and yellows with quiet; when clicked the mouse records the 'loudness', in addition to which state it is in, and plays back a sample of music with corresponding location and loudness.
